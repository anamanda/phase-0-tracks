# Week 5 Practice Assessment

# define method that takes an integer, operator string, and another integer
def calculate(integer1, operator_string, integer2)
  # use the Object#send method to convert operator string into operator
  # call it on integer1 and then use the second integer to complete operation
  integer1.send(operator_string, integer2)
end

# driver code that will test all four operators
# p calculate(1, '+', 4) # should equal 5
# p calculate(4, '-', 1) # should equal 3
# p calculate(4, '*', 5) # should equal 20
# p calculate(10, '/', 5) # should equal 2


# prompt user to enter a calculation
puts "Please enter a calculation you would like to perform, and type 'done' when finished (integer + operation + integer):"
user_input = gets.chomp

# creat empty array where the calculation history will be stored
# create variable that starts at 0 and will be added 1 to each time the calculation is performed
calculation_storage = []
number_of_times = 0

# create loop to keep prompting user until they type done
until user_input == "done"

  # scan the user input for the first integer
  user_integer1 = user_input.scan(/\d+/).first.to_i

  # remove user_integer1 from user_input
  user_input.delete!(user_integer1.to_s)

  # scan the user input for the second integer
  user_integer2 = user_input.scan(/\d+/).last.to_i

  # remove user_integer2 from user_input
  user_input.delete!(user_integer2.to_s)

  # remove whitespace around remaining string, which is ' operator '
  user_input.delete!(' ')

  # set user_operation to remaining string
  user_operation = user_input

  # store result of calculate method on user input in 'result' variable
  result = calculate(user_integer1, user_operation, user_integer2)

  # print result of calculate method with user input
  p result

  # add the sentence "integer1 + operation + integer2 = result" to calculation_storage array, to be called later
  calculation_storage.push("#{user_integer1} #{user_operation} #{user_integer2} = #{result}")

  # add 1 to the number of times the loop has been completed
