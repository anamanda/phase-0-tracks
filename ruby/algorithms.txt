Elevator Algorithm

-Pick a random number on the elevator panel
  -If it is higher than your number, you need to count down
    -Move left until you either
      a) get to your number
        -If you get to your number, press it
      b) hit the beginning of the row
        -If you reach the farthest left of your row, go to the row below that
        -Start counting from the right of that row (go to parent step and repeat until you get option a))

  -If the random number is lower than your number, you need to count up
    -Move right until you either
      a) get to your number
        -If you get to your number, press it
      b) hit the end of the row
        -If you reach the farthest right of your row, go to the row above that
        -Start counting from the left of that row (go to parent step and repeat until you get option a))


Subway Algorithm

-Walk down the stairs into the subway station
-Walk through the turnstiles
-If it is a station with an uptown/downtown or east/west option
  -If uptown and downtown or east and west are in separate places
    -Look at the signs above the platform to figure out which place to go for the train going in the correct direction, and go there
      -If there are two sides to the platform with trains going in your direction
        -Look at the signs to tell which side your train is coming on
          a) If there are multiple trains that come to your side (which you can find on the signs above the platform)
            -Wait until your train comes and then get on it
          b) If your train is the only train coming on that side, get on the first train that comes
      -If there is only one side to the platform
        a) If there are multiple trains that come to your side (which you can find on the signs above the platform)
          -Wait until your train comes and then get on it
        b) If your train is the only train coming on that side, get on the first train that comes
  -If uptown and downtown or east and west are in the same place (on the same platform), but on different sides
    -Look at the signs to figure out which side your train is coming on
      a) If there are multiple trains that come to your side (which you can find on the signs above the platform)
         -Wait until your train comes and then get on it
      b) If your train is the only train coming on that side, get on the first train that comes
-If it is a station with trains going in only one direction
  a) If there are multiple trains that come to the platform (which you can find on the signs above the platform)
    -Wait until your train comes and then get on it
  b) If your train is the only train coming on that side, get on the first train that comes
