# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps track of a repository's progress via save points. It's useful as it allows you to go back into previous versions of your code. This can be used for debugging, reference, experimenting, etc.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of your entire repository. The master branch is supposed to be the pure / clean version of your repository, and you make feature branches (copies of this branch) to work on. This way, you only merge your feature branch with the master branch once you are certain of the changes you made on the feature branch.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point, and essentially creates a version of your repository. A good commit message is straight to the point, but with enough detail to know what changes were made in this version.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict is when there is code that does not align on the branches you are merging. This can be fixed by going into the branches and figuring out which code is the correct code to keep for the merge, or if new code needs to be written altogether.
