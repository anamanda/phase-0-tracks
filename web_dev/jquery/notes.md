**JQuery**

I plan to use JQuery to make a mustache and glasses appear on the picture of a puppy. I might add a few more elements I see fit if as I discover new things I find pertaining.

I plan to use several resources to teach myself some JQuery. I think W3 will be my first go-to, and then I might look at some YouTube videos. I'll probably mostly use Google for any questions I have or any concepts I don't immediately understand.

I'd like to stop and test my work as often as possible. Since code can be affected by one letter, one number, one symbol, etc, I'd like to know what I'm changing, even when I make a tiny change. I think that's important when learning a new concept.

I will definitely take breaks. I think I'm going to work 20 minutes, and take a small break, and repeat, until I feel I have explored enough for my first JQuery challenge.
